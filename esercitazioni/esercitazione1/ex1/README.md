# Exercise: Reverse an Array of Integers

## Objective:
Write an ARMv7 assembly program that sums the first 30 numbers and stores the result into register r1. The program should run bare metal and use a single function to perform the reversal.

## Problem Breakdown:
* Define an array of integers in the .data section.
* Write a function that reverses the elements of the array in-place.
* Call the function from the main program and store the reversed array back into memory.


## Test the program:
Use the online emulator at [https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm)
