				  @ we use a new addressing mode [R0, R2, LSL #2]: 
				  @ R0: The base address register. It holds the starting address of the memory location you're working with.
				  @ R2: The index register. It contains an offset, which is used to calculate the memory address relative to the base address in R0.
				  @ LSL #2: This is a logical shift left operation. It shifts the value in R2 left by 2 bits, effectively multiplying R2 by 4 
				  @(LSL #2 is the same as multiplying by 2^2 = 4) 
				  @This is often used in array indexing, where each element is 4 bytes (32-bit word size).
