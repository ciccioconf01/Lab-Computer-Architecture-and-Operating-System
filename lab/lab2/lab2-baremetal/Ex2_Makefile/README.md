### Create a Makefile

As you might have noticed in previous exercises, as your code and the number of files increase, it becomes more challenging to compile everything manually. To simplify this process, we use a tool called **Make**. 

**Make** is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading special files called **Makefiles**. These Makefiles specify how to derive the target program by defining rules for compiling, linking, and cleaning up. From now on, all of your exercises should include a Makefile to automate the build process for your code.

In this exercise, you will create a Makefile that will:

1. Compile all the source files.
2. Provide options for building the code in both normal and debug modes.
3. Run the compiled code in QEMU (a processor emulator).
4. Clean up generated files.

### Instructions:

1. **Copy Files:** Copy all the files from the `Ex1_DelayRoutine` folder into the current folder.
2. **Create Makefile:** Write a Makefile that will compile all the files in the folder, as shown in class. Follow the format and structure we discussed.
3. **Targets in Makefile:**
   - **all:** Compiles all files and generates the executable.
   - **debug:** Compiles all files in debug mode and generates the executable with debugging information.
   - **qemu_start:** Runs the code in QEMU.
   - **qemu_debug:** Runs the code in QEMU in debug mode (stops at the first instruction and opens `localhost:1234` for GDB debugging).
   - **clean:** Removes all files generated by the Makefile (object files, executable files, etc.).

### Guide to Creating a Generic Makefile

A Makefile automates the process of compiling, linking, and running your program. Follow the steps
below to help you create the makefile for your exercises.

### 1. **Basic Structure of a Makefile**

A Makefile typically consists of the following components:

- **Variables**: Used to define the compiler, flags, source files, etc.
- **Targets**: These are the goals (e.g., compile, link, run) you want the Makefile to achieve.
- **Rules**: Commands that are executed to achieve the target.

Here is a basic structure of a Makefile that you can use to create your own Makefile:

```make 
# Variables
# Compiler
CC = gcc
# Compiler flags
CFLAGS = -Wall -g

# Target executable 
TARGET = main
# Source files
SRCS = main.c
# Object files
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

# Rules 
# Default target
all: $(TARGET)

# Rule to link object files into the final executable
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(OBJS) -o $(TARGET)

# Rule to compile source files into object files
%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

# Clean rule to remove compiled files
clean:
	rm -f *.o 

```
