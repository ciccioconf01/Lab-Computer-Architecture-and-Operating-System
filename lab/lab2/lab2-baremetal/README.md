# Lab2 - baremetal

## Getting started

In this lab, you will learn how to write simple bare-metal programs emulating an ARM processor using
the QEMU emulator. The lab consists on 3 exercises, each one with a different level of complexity.

- Clone the repository and you will find 3 folders: `Ex1_DelayRoutine`, `Ex2_Makefile` and
  `Ex3_UART`.

- The first exercise consist on writing a simple delay function on the ARM assembly language.
    [Exercise Delay Routine](./Ex1_DelayRoutine/README.md)
- The second exercise consist your own makefile to help you compile your code in a faster way.
    [Exercise Makefile](./Ex2_Makefile/README.md)
- The third exercise consist on writing a simple driver for the UART peripheral.
    [Exercise UART Simple Driver](./Ex3_UART/README.md)
